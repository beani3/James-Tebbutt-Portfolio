This is my C++ Shader Programming assignment. The brief for the assignment was to "Effectively communicate knowledge of a shader programming workflow and realise an interactive 3D scene which is lit with a recognised simulated lighting model (Blinn Phong)". The work I produced got me 80% which is a grade I am extremely happy with.

Below you will find the controls to navigate the program:

- W, A, S, D : Move forward (W), Left (A), backwards (S), and right (D)
- Mouse Scroll Wheel - Zoom in
- G : Toggle directional light
- H : Toggle normal mapping
- J : Toggle point lights
- K : Toggle spotlight
